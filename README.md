## Readme
This repository contains three codes:
* A code that checks eligibility for betting
* A code that checks for leap years
* A code that finds the power of a number
### Code 1: Eligibility for betting
This code checks whether a person is eligible to bet. The following are the criteria for eligibility:
* The person must be at least 18 years old.
* The person must be a resident of the United States.
* The person must have a valid ID.
The code first checks the person's age. If the person is under 18 years old, the code returns `False`. Otherwise, the code checks the person's residency. If the person is not a resident of the United States, the code returns `False`. Otherwise, the code checks the person's ID. If the person does not have a valid ID, the code returns `False`. Otherwise, the code returns `True`.
### Code 2: Leap years
This code checks whether a year is a leap year. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.
The code first checks whether the year is divisible by 4. If the year is divisible by 4, the code checks whether the year is divisible by 100. If the year is divisible by 100, the code checks whether the year is divisible by 400. If the year is divisible by 400, the code returns `True`. Otherwise, the code returns `False`.
### Code 3: Power of a number
This code finds the power of a number. The power of a number is the product of the number multiplied by itself a certain number of times.
The code first asks the user to enter the base number and the exponent. The base number is the number that is being raised to a power. The exponent is the number of times the base number is being multiplied by itself.
The code then uses a loop to multiply the base number by itself the number of times specified by the exponent. The result of the loop is the power of the number.
